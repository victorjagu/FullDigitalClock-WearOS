# Wear OS Digital Clock with Seconds

A high-performance, battery-optimized digital clock application designed specifically for Wear OS devices. Built entirely using **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose for Wear OS**, this standalone watch application provides a precise time display with seconds, featuring advanced lifecycle management and dynamic screen timeout configuration.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **OLED-Optimized Dark Mode**: Features a pure black `#000000` background that turns off physical pixels on OLED screens to drastically reduce power consumption.
* **Dynamic Screen-On Toggle**: Simple tap gestures allow the user to toggle between standard system timeout (White text) and persistent Ambient Screen-On mode (Dim Red text).
* **Zero-Lag Startup**: Uses primitive native variables instead of traditional Compose States for critical Window Flags, completely removing activity initialization delays.
* **Strict Battery Optimization**: Automatically halts UI recomposition and background coroutine timers the millisecond the application goes off-screen (`onPause`).
* **Auto-Scale Typography**: Dynamically calculates the available horizontal viewport (`BoxWithConstraints`) to scale the font to the absolute maximum size without clipping or text wrapping.
* **Aggressive Memory Management**: Clears residual process footprints and frees allocated RAM instantly upon exit (`android.os.Process.killProcess`).

## 🛠️ Architecture & Architecture Highlights

The codebase is optimized for low-resource wearable chips, adhering to strict Wear OS lifecycle standards:

* **Precise Sizing**: Uses standard monospace layout assumptions to fit `HH:mm:ss` inside any circular or rectangular Wear OS watch face dynamically.
* **Lifecycle Awareness**: Coroutine scopes live strictly under the visible lifecycle of the UI (`LaunchedEffect(isAppVisible)`), safeguarding against battery drain when the screen is dimmed or covered.
* **Swipe-to-Dismiss Protection**: Overrides `onStart` and `onPause` lifecycle hooks to clear window flags and prevent system-wide lockups when the user swipes to exit.

## 📋 Requirements

* **Minimum SDK**: Android API 26 (Wear OS 2.0 and above)
* **Target SDK**: Android API 33+ (Wear OS 4.0+)
* **Language**: Kotlin 1.9+
* **UI Toolkit**: Jetpack Compose for Wear OS

## 📦 Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com
   ```
2. **Open in Android Studio**:
   Import the project into Android Studio Flamingo (or newer).
3. **Build & Run**:
   Connect your Wear OS device via Wi-Fi ADB or launch a Wear OS emulator, then click **Run 'app'**.
